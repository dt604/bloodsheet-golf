# BloodSheet Golf

BloodSheet Golf is a premium digital scorecard and settling tool for highly competitive, skins-and-Nassau playing golf groups.

## The Pitch
Golf apps today are either too casual (basic score tracking) or too complex (spreadsheets). **BloodSheet** strikes the perfect balance. It’s designed specifically for the weekend warrior group that plays for money, uses complicated formats like "Skins with a Pot" or "Team Nassau," and wants to track their net payouts across the season.

No more asking "wait, am I getting a stroke on this hole?" The app calculates the "Red Dot" handicap distributions instantly.
No more Venmo math in the parking lot. The app builds a comprehensive Ledger for every match and keeps a running lifetime tally for bragging rights.

BloodSheet Golf is fast, dark-mode only (to save battery on the course), and brings a premium, sports-betting app aesthetic to the fairways.

## Key Features
*   **"Red Dot" Handicap System:** Instantly see who gets strokes on which holes, calculated against the lowest handicap in the group.
*   **Live Scorecard:** Fast, single-tap entry for scores and side bets (Greenies, Sandies, Snakes). Real-time updates with "Saving..." states so you know your data is synced.
*   **Complex Formats Made Easy:** Built-in calculation engines for Standard Skins, Pot Mode Skins, Team Skins, and traditional match-play Nassau.
*   **The Ledger:** Automated post-round settlement. See exactly who owes whom, what side bets were won/lost, and copy totals right into Venmo.
*   **Lifetime Stats:** Dashboard tracking of Win Rate, Index, and Total BloodSheet Payouts across the season.

## Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for premium animations.
*   **Backend & DB:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS).
*   **State Management:** Zustand for local, immediate UI updates synced to Supabase.
*   **Routing:** React Router v6.

## Submission Note
